    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>I've never eaten a lot of oatmeal. Growing up, grits was the breakfast staple in our household. It wasn't that I
        didn't like oatmeal. It was more about the fact that my mom didn't really make oatmeal much. </p>

    <p>As a result, I've never been a big oatmeal eater as an adult. I guess it's all about what you're used to. That
        all changed once I tried baked oatmeal while working on a promotion for my first cookbook. </p>

    <p>I wanted to include some recipes in an e-book I was offering as an incentive for preorders. And that's when my
        love for oatmeal came to be when I attempted my very first baked oatmeal recipe.</p>

    <p>Baked oatmeal is nothing like the gummy, sticky instant oatmeal I remember as a child. This stuff is amazing. One
        of my favorite adaptations of baked oatmeal is this Pumpkin Pecan Baked Oatmeal. It very well might be my
        favorite! It almost comes out cake-like with a nutty flavor that combines with the classic pumpkin spice and
        pecan flavors to create a delicious fall treat.</p>

    <p>Not to mention, this is super easy to make with basically a dump-and-stir approach. It also reheats well and is
        great as leftovers! Add a drizzle of maple syrup or honey on top for an added boost of sweetness! Yum!</p>
